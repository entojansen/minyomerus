\section*{Introduction}
	The weevil genus \textit{Minyomerus} Horn, 1876 is currently assigned to the tribe Tanymecini Lacordaire, 1863, subtribe Tanymecina Lacoirdaire, 1863 (Curculionidae: Entiminae). 
	The genus was recently revised and includes a total of 17 described species distributed throughout the desert and plains regions of North America.
	Since the publication of our monographic revision of \textit{Minyomerus}, we have discovered four additional undescribed species, known to us only from limited numbers of specimens, yet falling neatly into the generic delimitation of \textit{Minyomerus} \textit{sensu} Jansen and Franz 2015.
	Here we describe these species and provide images of the holotypes and of dissected genitalia for the purpose of identification.
	We additionally conduct a morphological phylogenetic analysis of the genus to clarify the placement of these new taxa within \textit{Minyomerus}, based on the analysis provided in our previous work.
	An emended identification key to the species of \textit{Minyomerus} is given along with information on the geographic distribution of the herein described species.
	Where possible, we make note of host-plant records and briefly consider the historical biogeographic relationships of the new species.
	A more extensive discussion of the habits, distribution, and delimitation of the genus (and all of its constituent species) can found in the generic revision.
	
\section*{Materials and methods}
	The keen reader will note the alignment of the methods used in this manuscript with those of Jansen and Franz 2015. 
	For convenience and transparency, we provide an updated account of the methods used to generate the species descriptions, distribution maps, and phylogeny herein.
	Most importantly, we retain the format of the species descriptions, whereby we emphasize only those characters that vary significantly from the generic description, as explained below.
	
	\paragraph{Natural history observations} 
		Members of the genus \textit{Minyomerus} may be found on a variety of host plants, as indicated following each description.
		While many species appear to be generalists, the adults are consistently observed on the leaves and branches of the host feeding on the leaf tissue; all other life stages remain unknown.
		Members of this genus are commonly found in deserts throughout western North America, including the Mojave, Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Great Basin Deserts. 
		Furthermore, the range of the genus extends through the semi-arid regions of the Great Plains, the Colorado Plateau, and Baja California, M\'{e}xico. 
		The adults are flightless, as the hind wings and associated flight structures of all species are either greatly reduced or not readily apparent in dissection.

	\paragraph{Acquisition of museum specimens} 
		Georeferencing of localities was performed with Google Earth (Google Inc. 2009â€“2015) and reported in decimal degrees.
		Taxonomic names for associated host plants are used in accordance with Munz and Keck (1973) and SEINet (2017).
		The existing set of \textit{Minyomerus} specimens used in the revision of Jansen and Franz 2015 was supplemented with material from the following collections, using the codens of Arnett et al. (1993):
		
		\begin{description}[itemsep=-1ex]
			\item[\texttt{CMNC}] Canadian Museum of Nature Collection, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
			\item[\texttt{TAMU}] Texas A \& M University, College Station, Texas, USA
			\item[\texttt{USNM}] National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., USA
		\end{description}
		
	\paragraph{Morphological analysis}
		Our systematic and descriptive approach is complementary to Jansen and Franz 2015, which in turn follows Franz (2010a, 2010b, 2012).
		Terminology for exterior morphology is in general accordance with Torre-Bueno (Nichols 1989).
		Additional morphological terms specific to (entimine) weevils were used as follows:
			Ting (1936) and Morimoto and Kojima (2003) for mouthparts;
			Thompson (1992) for tibial apices and abdominal segments;
			and Oberprieler et al. (2014) and Howden (1995) for male and female terminalia.
		
		Measurements were taken with a Leica M205 C stereomicroscope and associated software, Leica Application Suite (LAS), version 4.1.0.
		Overall body length and width were measured in dorsal view as the maximum distance between the rostral and elytral apices, and the maximum width of both elytra, respectively.
		Rostral length was measured in dorsal view as the distance between the epistomal apex and the anterior margin of the eyes.
		Rostral width was measured in dorsal view as the maximum distance between the dorsal margins of the rostrum near the point of antennal insertion.
		Pronotal length was measured in dorsal view as the length along the midline between the anterior and posterior margins.
		The width of an individual elytron was measured in dorsal view as the maximum distance between the lateral margin and the elytral suture.
		Other length and width measurements were also performed in dorsal orientation, using the maximum length and width of the corresponding structure (profemur, protibia, elytron, and aedeagus).
		Images of mouthparts and terminalia were produced with the Leica microscope equipment, while habitus photographs were created with a Visionary Digital Passport II sytem using a Canon EOS Mark 5D II camera.

		Herein recognized species of \textit{Minyomerus}  were delimited through application of the phylogenetic species concept \textit{sensu} Wheeler and Platnick (2000).
		Species descriptions are in alphabetical order, rather than phylogetic order, for ease of use.
		The species descriptions in this manuscript represent unique and complementary accounts of the character states observed in each species, including their variability, but excepting those characters invariant within the genus as specified in the higher-level description of \textit{Minyomerus}.
		Likewise, descriptions of males emphasize characters that are variable and sufficiently different from those of the females to merit recognition.
		The key to identifying species of \textit{Minyomerus} is arranged with emphasis being placed on the most readily observable diagnostic characters.
		This manuscript is arranged with the species descriptions appearing first, followed by the key to species, and then by the phylogenetic results.
		
	\paragraph{Phylogenetic analysis}
		The morphological cladistic analysis includes 26 terminal taxa; with 21 ingroup and 5 outgroup terminals.
		The ingroup terminals were represented by 17 species previously assigned to \textit{Minyomerus} sec. Jansen and Franz (2015) and four newly recognized species.
		In keeping with our previous analysis, we sampled outgroups fairly broadly while remaining focused on North American lineages that are putative close relatives of the ingroup (Jansen and Franz 2015, Nixon and Carpenter 1993).
		Although the tribe Tanymecini [non-focal] is cosmopolitan, the majority of New World species diversity in the tribe may be found in the subtribe Tanymecina [non-focal] (Alonzo-Zarazaga and Lyal 1999).
		Thus, four of the five outgroup terminals are represented by species belonging to separate genera in the Tanymecina [non-focal]; viz. Isodacrys buchanani Howden, 1961 [non-focal], Isodrusus debilis Sharp, 1911 [non-focal], Pandeleteinus subcancer Howden, 1969 [non-focal], and Pandeleteius cinereus (Horn, 1876) [non-focal].
		Because generic relationships in the Tanymecini [non-focal] remain unresolved, we selected a relatively far-removed taxon to root the cladogram that would nevertheless display states applicable to the ingroup for characters under consideration (Rieppel 2007; Franz 2014).
		To this end we used the North American species Sitona californicus (Fahraeus, 1840) [non-focal], of the tribe Sitonini Gistel, 1856 [non-focal].
		
		The character matrix was edited and phylogenetic results viewed using the WinDada and WinClados interfaces of WinClada, respectively (Nixon 2002).
		The character sequence follows that of the taxonomic descriptions.
		The most parsimonious tree and character state optimizations were inferred under parsimony using NONA (Goloboff 1999).
		An unconstrained heuristic search was conducted using the commands: \texttt{hold 100001}, \texttt{mult*1000}, \texttt{hold/100}, with \texttt{mult*max*} selected.
		Bootstrap support was inferred in WinClada using the parameters of \texttt{1000 replications}, \texttt{hold 1000}, \texttt{hold/100}, \texttt{mult*10}, \texttt{Donâ€™t do max*}, and \texttt{Save consensus}.
		Finally, Bremer support values (Bremer 1994) were calculated in NONA using the commands: \texttt{hold 20000}, \texttt{suboptimal 20}, and \texttt{bsupport 20}.
	
	\paragraph{Species distribution modeling}
		We used the modeling program Maxent, Version 3.4, to generate habitat models for the species of Minyomerus [JF 2015] (Figs.~\#) based on documented occurrence records (Phillips et al. 2004, 2006; Elith et al. 2011).
		The default settings were adjusted to \texttt{Max number background points = 100,000} and \texttt{Iterations = 10}.
		Cross-validation was used to leverage all available locality data; however, no models could be created for species with two or fewer documented localities.
		We selected 19 bioclimatic variables and elevation as Environmental Layers in Maxent, obtained from WorldClim (see Hijmans et al. 2005).
		The layers were downloaded by tile (zones 11â€“13 and 21â€“23), with a 30 arc-second resolution (projected using WSG 84) to provide adequate coverage of the full distribution of the genus.
		Layerwise assembly of tiles was done using QGIS, Version 2.18.16 `Las Palmas', creating composite maps of six tiles each to use in species distribution modeling (Quantum GIS Development Team 2017).
		
		The rasterized predictive probabilities were imported into QGIS, where each file was designated a specific color. 
		Each pixel in the raster was assigned a linearly interpolated saturation of that color, with increasing saturation denoting an increased probability of successful prediction of species presence at that point.
		Pixels with a value below 0.50 were rendered transparent so that the maps only show regions with a greater than 50\% chance of successful prediction.
		The raster files were clipped to remove extraneous predicted regions based on: (1) predictive probability (i.e., removing large areas with only transparent pixels) and (2) geographic extent (accounting for endemicity).
		For example, a species endemic to the Snake River Valley of Idaho does not require a predictive model for bioclimatically similar habitats in the Chihuahuan Desert.
		Documented occurrence records are laid over the modeled habitat ranges as colored circles on their respective maps (Figs.~\#), along with vector layers of country (white) and state (gray) borders (Hijmans et al. 2012).
		
\section*{Descriptions of new species}
	\subsection*{\textit{Minyomerus ampullaceus} - sp. n.}
		\subsubsection*{Diagnosis}
			\textit{Minyomerus ampullaceus} is best differentiated from other congenerics by its unique body shape, which most prominently features a strongly constricted, sub-cylindrical pronotum and greatly protuberant elytra; this combination gives the species a distinctly flask- or bottle-shaped appearance.
			Due to the relatively poor condition of the scales and setae of the holotype, color and setation cannot be reliably used for identification.
			Fortunately, the elytra themselves are unique in shape, and diagnostic, together nearly 2\x the width of the pronotum at their widest point, and nearly 3/4 as wide as long in dorsal view.
			In lateral view the anterior and posterior declivities of the elytra are strongly abrupt, and nearly vertical; most notably, the anterior magin of the elytra projects strongly and characteristically dorsad of its articulation with the posterior pronotal margin.
			The spermatheca is also quite distinct, having a highly elongate projection of the corpus aligned with midline of the ramus, which is basally tapered and angled at nearly 45\td to the corpus.

		\subsubsection*{Description of male}
			Male not available or known.
		\subsubsection*{Comments}
			Due to the limited number of specimens of this species, dissections of mouthparts could not be performed.
		\subsubsection*{Etymology}
			Named in reference to the shape of the body in dorsal view, which appears bottle-shaped due to the large elytra and comparatively cylindrical pronotum; ampullaceus = flasklike; Latin adjective \citep{brown1956}.
		\subsubsection*{Material examined}
			\paragraph{Holotype}
				\female~``Carlsbad, N.M.; Geococcyx calif; 144640'' (\texttt{\textbf{USNM}}).
		\subsubsection*{Distribution}
			This species is known only from Carlsbad, New Mexico (USA), from an unspecified locality; the location of the city is shown in Fig.~\#.
		\subsubsection*{Natural history}
			No host plant associations have been documented.
			The label indicates ``Geococcyx calif''; this is presumably a reference to \textit{Geococcyx californianus} (Lesson, 1829) [Cuculidae], the Greater Roadrunner, although it is unclear if the specimen was found on or near one of these birds (either living, dead, or in a nest).
			\textit{Minyomerus} species are only known to be phytophagous, not parasitic, phoretic, or necrophagous, so we believe that this specimen was most likely found in a nest, and was present there only incidentally because the nest was constructed in the host plant of this specimen \citep{jansen2015}.
			It is unknown whether this species is parthenogenetic.
			
	\subsection*{\textit{Minyomerus franko} - sp. n.}
		\subsubsection*{Diagnosis}
			\textit{Minyomerus franko} is readily distinguished from other congenerics by the strikingly long setae of the anterior margin of the pronotum, which project laterally up to 80\td from the longitudinal axis of the body and achieve a maximum length at least equaling the diameter of the eye.
			In addition, the setae lining the dorsal margin of the ocular impression are elongate and reach a length equal to 1/2 - 3/4\x the diameter of the eye.
			The spermatheca has a short, somewhat bulbous corpus, with the ramus sub-equal in size and perpendicular to the corpus, and the collum is strongly recurved along the basal 1/3 of its length.
			The aedeagus is relatively short and wide, and is abruptly constricted in the apical 1/5 of its length, thereafter tapered to a rounded point.

	\subsection*{\textit{Minyomerus sculptilis} - sp. n.}
		\subsubsection*{Diagnosis}
			\textit{Minyomerus sculptilis} is best distinguished from other congenerics by a combination of characters, as follows.
			The interspersed setae on the body are linear and either brown or white.
			The anterior margin of the pronotum bears a reduced tuft of post-ocular vibrissae.
			The head is barely elevated between the eyes.
			The ventrolateral sulci of  the rostrum are well defined.
			The lateral face of each elytron has the intervals raised and well sculpted in appearance.
			The spermatheca is distinct and has an elongate, annulate, basally tapered ramus, which is slightly thinner than corpus.
			The cornu is strongly recurved in the basal half, giving it a uniquely sinuate appearance.
			Both the corpus and cornu terminate in large, hood-shaped, explanate projections equal in size to the ramus.
			The aedeagus is elongate, acutely angulate, and narrowing towards the apex more strongly in the region of the ostium.
