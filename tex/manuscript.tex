\section*{Materials and methods}
	\paragraph{Natural history observations} 
		Members of the genus Minyomerus are typically found on a variety of host plants, as indicated following each species account.
		Many species are likely generalists with regards to their host plant spectrum. 
		Adult weevils are most commonly observed on the leaves and branches of the host where they feed on the leaf tissue. Eggs, larvae, and pupae remain unknown. 
		The larvae are probably root feeders, as observed in the tanymecine genus Tanymecus Germar, 1817 (Howden 1975). 
		They typically inhabit arid regions, especially deserts, throughout southwestern North America, including the Mojave, Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Great Basin Deserts. 
		They also occur in semi-arid regions of the Great Plains, on the Colorado Plateau, and throughout Baja California, Mexico. 
		The adults apparently disperse without flight, as the hind wings and associated flight structures of all species in the genus are greatly reduced and not readily apparent after dissections.
		In several species only females are known, and some are putatively considered parthenogenetic, as indicated in the respective descriptions.

	\paragraph{Acquisition of museum specimens} 
		Georeferencing of localities was performed with Google Earth (Google Inc. 2009–2015) and reported in decimal degrees.
		Taxonomic names for associated host plants are used in accordance with Munz and Keck (1973) and SEINet (2015).
		The set of existing \textit{Minyomerus} [JF2015] specimens used in the revision of Jansen and Franz 2015 was supplemented with material from the following collections, using the codens of Arnett et al. (1993):

			\item[\texttt{USNM}] National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., USA
		\end{description}
		
	\paragraph{Morphological analysis}
		The herein utilized systematic and descriptive approach follows Franz (2010a, 2010b, 2012).
		Terminology for exterior morphology is in general accordance with Torre-Bueno (Nichols 1989).
		Additional morphological terms specific to (entimine) weevils were used as follows:
			Ting (1936) and Morimoto and Kojima (2003) for mouthparts;
			Thompson (1992) for tibial apices and abdominal segments;
			and Oberprieler et al. (2014) and Howden (1995) for male and female terminalia.
		All measurements were taken using a Leica M205 C stereomicroscope and attached computer running the software Leica Application Suite (LAS), version 4.1.0.
		The overall body length and width were measured in dorsal view as the maximum distance between the apex of the rostrum and the apex of the elytra, and the maximum width of the elytra, respectively.
		The length of the rostrum was measured in dorsal view as the distance extending from the apex of the epistoma to the anterior margin of the eyes.
		The width of the rostrum was measured in dorsal view as the maximum distance between the dorsal margins of the rostrum near the point of antennal insertion.
		The length of the pronotum was measured in dorsal view as the length along the midline from the anterior margin to the posterior margin.
		The width of the elytra was measured in dorsal view as the maximum distance between the lateral margin and the elytral suture.
		Other length and width measurements were performed in dorsal orientation, as the maximum length and width of the corresponding structure (profemur, protibia, elytron, and aedeagus).
		Images of mouthparts and terminalia were produced with the Leica microscope equipment, whereas habitus photographs were created with a Visionary Digital Passport II sytem using a Canon EOS Mark 5D II camera.

		Species of Minyomerus [JF2015] recognized in this revision were delimited through application of the phylogenetic species concept sensu Wheeler and Platnick (2000).
		Species descriptions follow the inferred phylogenetic sequence (see details below).
		The genus-level description for Minyomerus [JF2015] highlights characters present in all members and accounts for their apparent variability.
		Consequently, the species descriptions represent unique and complementary accounts of the character states observed in each species, including their variability, and excepting characters that are invariate within the genus as specified in the higher-level description of Minyomerus.
		Likewise, descriptions of males in the genus- and species-level accounts emphasize characters that are variable and sufficiently different from those of the females to merit recognition.
		Some redundancy occurs between genus and species descriptions when discussing characters that vary widely within single species, and also between species descriptions where a character exhibits considerable variation in some species yet is invariant in others.
		The key to identifying species of Minyomerus is arranged with emphasis being placed on the most readily observable diagnostic characters.
		The revision is arranged with the species descriptions appearing first, followed by the key to species, and then by the phylogenetic results.
		
	\paragraph{Phylogenetic analysis}
		The morphological cladistic analysis includes 22 terminal taxa; with 17 ingroup and 5 outgroup terminals.
		Following resolution of species identities and boundaries, the ingroup terminals were represented by six species previously assigned to Minyomerus sec. O’Brien and Wibmer (1982), Piscatopus griseus sec. Sleeper (1960), and ten newly recognized species.
		The lack of prior phylogenetic analyses of Minyomerus and closely related lineages made it necessary to sample outgroups fairly broadly while remaining focused on North American lineages that are are putative close relatives of the ingroup (Nixon and Carpenter 1993).
		The tribe Tanymecini [non-focal] is cosmopolitan, with the subtribe Tanymecina [non-focal] containing the majority of New World species diversity in the tribe (Alonzo-Zarazaga and Lyal 1999).
		Accordingly, four outgroup terminals are represented by species belonging to separate genera in the Tanymecina [non-focal]; viz. Pandeleteius cinereus (Horn, 1876) [non-focal], Pandeleteinus subcancer Howden, 1969 [non-focal], Isodrusus debilis Sharp, 1911 [non-focal], and Isodacrys buchanani Howden, 1961 [non-focal].
		Because generic relationships in the Tanymecini [non-focal] remain unresolved, it was deemed prudent to find a relatively far-removed taxon to root the cladogram that would nevertheless display states that are applicable to the ingroup for all characters under consideration (Rieppel 2007; Franz 2014).
		For this purpose we select the North American species Sitona californicus (Fahraeus, 1840) [non-focal], representing the tribe Sitonini Gistel, 1856 [non-focal].
		The character matrix was edited and phylogenetic results reviewed and reconnected to the input using the WinDada and WinClados interfaces of WinClada (Nixon 2002).
		The character sequence follows that of the taxonomic descriptions.
		The most parsimonious tree and character state optimizations were inferred under parsimony using NONA (Goloboff 1999).
		An unconstrained heuristic search of tree space for the 22-terminal matrix was conducted using the commands: hold 100001, mult*1000, hold/100, with mult*max* selected.
		Bootstrap support was inferred in WinClada using the parameters of 1000 replications, hold 1000, hold/100, mult*10, “Don’t do max*”, and “Save consensus”.
		Finally, Bremer support values (Bremer 1994) were calculated in NONA using the commands hold 20000, suboptimal 20, and bsupport 20.
	\paragraph{Species distribution modeling}
		We used the modeling program Maxent, Version 3.3, to generate habitat models for the species of Minyomerus [JF 2015] (Figs 50–52) based on the documented occurrence records (Phillips et al. 2004, 2006; Elith et al. 2011).
		The default settings “Max number background points”, set to 100,000, and “Iterations” set to 10 and with cross-validation, were applied to leverage all available locality data.
		However, no models could be created for three species with single documented localities; and only a single-iteration habitat model could be generated for a fourth species due to limited information data.
		We selected 19 bioclimatic variables and elevation as Environmental Layers in Maxent, obtained from WorldClim (see Hijmans et al. 2005 and the associated website for further detail on variables).
		The layers were downloaded by tile (zones 11–13 and 21–23), with a 30 arc-second resolution (projected using WSG 84) to provide adequate coverage of the full distribution of Minyomerus [JF2015].
		These tiles were assembled, by layer, into composite maps of six tiles each, using QGIS, Version 2.8.1 ‘Wien’, prior to species distribution modeling (Quantum GIS Development Team 2015).
		After modeling, the raster files of the predictive probabilities were imported into GIS.
		Each file was designated a specific color, and each pixel in the raster grid was assigned a linearly interpolated saturation of that color, with increasing saturation denoting an increased probability of successful prediction of species presence at that point.
		Pixels with a value below 0.50 were rendered transparent so that the model only shows regions with a greater than 50\% chance of successful prediction.
		The raster files were clipped to remove extraneous predicted regions based on: (1) predictive probability (i.e., removing large areas with only transparent pixels) and (2) geographic extent (accounting for endemicity).
		For instance, species endemic to Baja California Sur, Mexico, do not require a predictive model for bioclimatically similar habitats in Canada.
		The actual (documented) occurrence records are laid over the modeled habitat ranges as colored circles on the respetive maps (Figs 50–52), along with vector layers of country and state borders (Hijmans et al. 2012).

		\subsubsection*{Description of male}
			Male not available or known.
		\subsubsection*{Comments}
			Due to the limited number of specimens of this species, dissections of mouthparts could not be performed.
		\subsubsection*{Etymology}
			Named in reference to the shape of the body in dorsal view, which appears bottle-shaped due to the large elytra and comparatively cylindrical pronotum; ampullaceus = flasklike; Latin adjective \citep{brown1956}.
		\subsubsection*{Material examined}
			\paragraph{Holotype}
				\female~``Carlsbad, N.M.; Geococcyx calif; 144640'' (\texttt{\textbf{USNM}}).
		\subsubsection*{Distribution}
			\#
		\subsubsection*{Natural history}
			No host plant associations have been documented.
			The label indicates "Geococcyx calif"; this is presumably a reference to \textit{Geococcyx californianus} (Lesson, 1829) [Cuculidae], the Greater Roadrunner, although it is unclear if the specimen was found on or near one of these birds (either living, dead, or in a nest).
			\textit{Minyomerus} species are only known to be phytophagous, not parasitic, phoretic, or necrophagous, so we believe that this specimen was most likely found in a nest, and was present there only incidentally because the nest was constructed in the host plant of this specimen \citep{jansen2015}.
			It is unknown whether this species is parthenogenetic.
